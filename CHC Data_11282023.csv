2019-09-09 15:24,Bad roof leaks . Clients catch water in buckets whenever it rains.,"The roof leaks for several reasons. First, the metal is old (circa 1970?) and repeated applications of aluminum- tar and other products have not solved the leak problem. The other reason is that the pitch is too flat, a 1/12 pitch on either side. The steep part of the roof is an 8/12 pitch.

Roof square footage is approx. 700 square feet. There are two 16"" x 16"" masonry chimneys and one 1 1/2/"" plumbing vent. There is an electrical weatherhead on the side.

The solution to this problem would involve re-framing the existing roof on top of what is already there. Installing new rafters from the peak to the outside walls would create a 4/12 pitch. Then add perlins and metal. There are a lot of details to work out, and the rafters would have to be 22 feet long (I- joists?) and/or possibly supported by a knee wall above the interior, load bearing wall.

It looked like the framing of the existing roof and walls is good enough to support the extra weight of the build- over, but you should probably get a second opinion.

This would cost a lot but might be worth is because the house is otherwise in fairly decent condition, and re-doing the roof would make it last a lot longer.

Rails are not built correctly and are not sturdy enough.,"Some work has been done here by volunteers a couple of years ago. The concrete deck has been busted up and removed. Wood framing and pressure treated 5/4 deck boards were installed in its place. The Deck now has a slope away from the house, which is good, but plastic sheeting was placed on top of the framing before the deck boards were installed, causing water to pool up between the deck boards and deteriorate the wood (it cannot dry out.)

I suspect the reason that the plastic was installed was to try to keep water out of the space under the deck. The deck is underpinned with cinder blocks. There is an airspace between the joists, so water won't be totally trapped under there. The plastic needs to come off. Replace the deck boards if they have started to rot on the bottom. Reuse if still in good shape.

Some kind of drainage system may be needed to get rid of water under the deck but I do not know exactly how to do this right now.

Their home is on a gravity-fed system, which works but requires maintenance. There is a good reservoir, but the spring is a lot further up. Nita's solution is to just get the water out of the small creek. The problem here, although the watershed is clean, is that the pipes get clogged up frequently even with a screen. Nita, at 81, is still able to walk up the holler and maintain the pipes, but it is getting harder, and she has to do it often, sometimes once a day in rainy weather.

The family is afraid, with good reason, that a water heater will get clogged up with silt.

When the wall fell the drain line to the septic broke. This has been repaired by the homeowner so the septic system works.

According to Tom, the drain lines run out the back side, where the wall fell, and around to the front yard where the septic tank is. He says there is room to dig behind there to install a French drain.

Once the porch floor is solid, remove ceiling material. Repair framing from below so that the roof can be safe enough to stand on. Once the roof framing is solid, roof repair can commence. Since the sheathing needs repair, you will have to remove the 2 layers of shingles. You will probably have to remove at least half of the shingles on one side of the house.

2016-04-08 12:15,Roof is leaking.,"Repair roof. This is a difficult problem.  Although the roof is metal and it is in good shape, a large section of this roof is very flat (3/4"" in 12"", with screws in the flats). With this lack of slope, it could be leaking almost anywhere, and traveling to other places.  There is one patch (above the stove pipe hole in the kitchen) that is leaking, and could be fixed by installing a whole new sheet of metal.  The metal is an unusual kind, it is 3' wide, but has a different profile than your standard roof metal.  The short-term solution would be to replace the metal as stated above, and re-flash around the wood stove chimney (which also needs work).  This would not fix all the leaks.  The long term solution would be tear off the flat section of roof metal and re-frame the roof.
